## WHAT INVESTORS SAY
Although stringent measures such as symmetric
encryption are in place to make e-payment safe and
secure, it is still vulnerable to hacking.
Enterprises with in-house e-payment systems must incur
additional costs in procuring, installing and maintaining
sophisticated payment-security technologies.
There is no guarantee that people who post projects on
Kickstarter will deliver on their projects, use the money to
implement their projects, or that the completed projects
will meet backers' expectations.

## WHAT WE PROPOSE
Making transaction histories more transparent and
secure through the use of blockchain technology.
Because Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, all
network participants share the same documentation as
opposed to individual copies.
Contributors can decide Where to invest and can
Acknowledge the requests for money made by the
Project Creators through their votes.The creator can only

used for Necessities rather than Luxuries.TECHNOLOGY STACK
